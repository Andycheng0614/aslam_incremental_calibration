NEXT STEP:
Creat the calibration design variables.
Needed:
 * Intrinsic calibration parameters of the camera
 * Extrinsics of the camera system.
Interface:
void createDesignVariables( NCameraSystem & system, bool doIntrinsics, bool doExtrinsics );

[X] Finish filling in CameraGeometry.hpp
[X] Test CameraGeometry.hpp
[X] Add the intrinsics jacobian to the camerasystem interface
[X] Add the distortion jacobian to the camerasystem interface
[X] Add the jacobian with respect to the shutter parameters? dt/dp "Keypoint time and jacobian"
[X] Add flags to the camera about what is being optimized
